Varianti,"Sposi per un anno. Questo è il patto che Nick e Susy Lansing hanno stipulato: rimanere uniti nella buona sorte fino a quando il denaro dei regali di nozze e l'ospitalità degli amici consentirà loro di continuare la luna di miele. Poi, se una migliore occasione si presenterà a uno di loro, l'altro acconsentirà a lasciarlo libero. Lo scenario dei primi mesi di questa anomala unione è idilliaco: una romantica villa sulle sponde del lago di Como, un palazzo patrizio a Venezia, passeggiate nelle calli ombrose, chiari di luna, amici spensierati sempre pronti ad assecondare i due novelli sposi. Eppure, fin dall'inizio, la macchina perfetta del matrimonio concordato si inceppa, incalzata da un elemento imprevisto: l'amore. Capriccioso, incoerente, poco incline a compromessi e a sfumature, l'amore si insinua nella mente ordinata e onesta di Nick, che ha idealizzato la moglie al punto di non poterle perdonare nessuno sbaglio, nessuna leggerezza, e in quella di Susy, incapace di rinunciare ai suoi sogni di grandezza se non per il marito, ma così spaventata da questa scoperta da non riuscire a dirglielo, anche quando sarebbe l'unico modo per trattenerlo. E allora, di nuovo soli, ""liberi"", come amavano dire prima di sposarsi, Nick e Susy cercano ognuno la propria occasione lontano dall'altro, lui sul panfilo di ricchi amici, lei nientemeno che con un lord. Ma l'amore che paradossalmente li ha separati, si è talmente insinuato nel loro cuore da ricongiungerli.",24662849,3.83,Italian,2372,Edith Wharton,270 pages,The Glimpses of the Moon,Paperback

Second Edition,"Few topics in the Western intellectual tradition have been subjected to as much scrutiny and analysis as the topic of race. This book examines the evolution of the concept. It shows that late-eighteenth-century North Americans came to believe that their society was composed of biologically exclusive and permanently unequal human groups, each with distinctive behavioral, moral, spiritual, and intellectual characteristics, led people to see biophysical and behavioral features as innate and immutable. In the nineteenth century, differences between whites, American Indians, and blacks were magnified in the popular mind and in scholarly writings to the point that these groups were seen as separate species, justifying the preservation of “racial” slavery and the subsequent dehumanization of freed blacks. With the application in the late nineteenth century of the racial worldview to European peoples and the subsequent twentieth-century inhumanity and brutality of Nazi race ideology, the concept of race came under attack. Liberal ideology coupled with advances in science prompted criticism of “race” and efforts to eliminate the term from the lexicon of science.In a sweeping work that traces the idea of race through three centuries of North American history, Audrey Smedley shows race to be a cultural construct used variously and opportunistically throughout time, although the scientific record shows little common agreement on its meaning. Tracing the social and historical processes that helped shape the idea of race, Smedley argues that race was and is a folk worldview, fabricated as an existential reality out of elements of English cultural history and the conquest and enslavement of physically distinct populations. The schism between science and popular thought on race, which appeared in the mid-twentieth century, continues today. If progressive scientists no longer accept the biological idea of race, will society eventually also reject it?The second edition expands its coverage of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, particularly in matters of IQ testing and changing racial attitudes, including the contemporary movement aimed at identifying a “mixed race” category in the U.S. census. Smedley further examines the economic, social, and political factors after World War II that directly or indirectly affected the public’s thinking about race and discusses how the Civil Rights Movement and television during the 1950s and 1960s prompted greater attention to race and racism, causing many to rethink their beliefs and values. The first edition was named a 1994 Outstanding Book on Human Rights in North America by the Gustavus Myers Center.",2147176,4.16,English,87,Audrey Smedley,400 pages,Race in North America: Origin And Evolution of a Worldview,Paperback
La Historieta Argentina,Hipólito Bouchard nació el 15 de enero de 1780 en Bormes. cerca de las bellas playas de Saint-Tropez en la Costa Azul de Francia. Su vida aventurera comenzó cuando. siendo un muchachito. decidió incorporarse a la marina y participar en la campaña de Napoleón a Egipto bajo las órdenes de su tocayo el corsario francés Hipólito Mordell. Llegó a Buenos Aires a los 26 años mientras se producía la Segunda Invasión Inglesa. justo a tiempo para colaborar en la Reconquista a las órdenes de Liniers.El muchacho de Saint-Tropez tenía ideas liberales y revolucionarias. lo que por entonces no era contradictorio sino complementario. En 1810 soplaban nuevos vientos de cambio y. al producirse la revolución. se vinculó con el sector más radical de la Junta. liderado por Mariano Moreno. y puso sus conocimientos navales a disposición del gobierno revolucionario. El 1 de febrero de 1811. la Secretaría de Guerra lo designó comandante del bergantín 25 de Mayo dentro de la pequeña flota nacional que comandaba el maltés Juan Bautista Azopardo. La atrevida flotilla insurgente . como la llamará el soberbio jefe español de Montevideo Javier de Elío. tuvo su bautismo de fuego el 2 de marzo de 1811 en el combate de San Nicolás de los Arroyos. Lamentablemente fue una derrota.Pero el 3 de febrero de 1813 otro bautismo de fuego. el del Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo (al mando de San Martín) en San Lorenzo. encontró nuevamente a Bouchard dispuesto a todo. Durante la batalla quiso quedarse con un souvenir de su primer combate terrestre en suelo americano; como el abanderado español se negaba a entregar el rojo pabellón . lo liquidó ahí nomás. Dice el jefe de los Granaderos en el parte de guerra: Una bandera que pongo en manos de V.E. y que arrancó con la vida del abanderado el oficial don Hipólito Bouchard .Pocos días después. el 22 de febrero.,2969715,0.0,Spanish,0,Felipe Pigna,50 pages,"La Historieta Argentina: Bouchard, El Corsario De La Patria",Paperback

Complete Edition,"Katherine Mansfield (1888-1923) published three collections of short stories -- In a German Pension, Bliss, and The Garden Party -- during her tragically short life, and was acclaimed as one of modernism's most daring and original writers. After her death from tuberculosis in France, Mansfield's private writings and letters were edited by her husband, John Middleton Murry, and published in four volumes between 1927 and 1954. Murry, however, took liberties in recasting his wife's journals and notes. He excluded most of the vast mass of material and revised much of what he included, resulting in a distorted image of Mansfield as a passive, ethereal spirit.More than four decades later, the real Mansfield finally emerges in The Katherine Mansfield Notebooks, the first unexpurgated edition of her private writings. Fully and accurately transcribed by editor Margaret Scott, these infrequent diary entries, drafts of letters, introspective notes jotted on scraps of paper, unfinished stories, half-plotted novels, poems, recipes, and shopping lists offer a complete and compelling portrait of a complex woman who was ambitious and at times ruthless, neurotic and sexually voracious, witty and acerbic, fascinated with the minutiae of daily life and obsessed with death.",188088,4.23,English,39,Katherine Mansfield,665 pages,The Katherine Mansfield Notebooks,Paperback

In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie: man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than thirty years after its publication.

Second Edition,"In this impressive second edition of Theory of Knowledge, Keith Lehrer introduces students to the major traditional and contemporary accounts of knowing. Beginning with the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief, Lehrer explores the truth, belief, and justification conditions on the way to a thorough examination of foundation theories of knowledge,the work of Platinga, externalism and naturalized epistemologies, internalism and modern coherence theories, contextualism, and recent reliabilist and causal theories. Lehrer gives all views careful examination and concludes that external factors must be matched by appropriate internal factors to yield knowledge. This match of internal and external factors follows from Lehrer's new coherence theory of undefeated justification. In addition to doing justice to the living epistemological traditions, the text smoothly integrates several new lines that will interest scholars. Also, a feature of special interest is Lehrer's concept of a justification game.This second edition of Theory of Knowledge is a thoroughly revised and updated version that contains several completely new chapters. Written by a well-known scholar and contributor to modern epistemology, this text is distinguished by clarity of structure, accessible writing, and an elegant mix of traditional material, contemporary ideas, and well-motivated innovation.",838965,3.37,English,19,Keith Lehrer,272 pages,Theory of Knowledge,Paperback

As a psychotherapist and researcher, Lawrence LeShan is more interested in the process and effects of meditation than the spiritual motivations. To LeShan, meditation means training the mind, and he likens it to physical exercise. Like a good trainer, he breaks down the different kinds of meditation into easy-to-learn steps and offers counsel about the best ways to go about it and the pitfalls you are likely to encounter. LeShan isn't pure vanilla, however. He wrote at a time (the early '70s) when meditation was still considered esoteric and strongly associated with the paranormal. Still, he keeps his feet on the ground and suggests that you do, too. Meditation, he says, helps get a new perspective on the world and to attain ""an increased serenity and competence in being.""

Fischer Taschenbuch,"Dieses Buch, so schrieb Foucault im Nachwort, ist ein Versuch, in dem so verworenen, so wenig und so schlecht strukturierten Bereich der Ideengeschichte zu einer Methode zu gelangen. Diese Methode, die Foucault als eine Archäologie der Humanwissenschaften begriff, operiert hier auf scheinbar schmaler historischer Basis: die Geschichte der Medizin an der Wende vom 18. zum 19. Jahrhundert. Es ist dies nicht nur die Epoche der Aufklärung und der Französischen Revolution, sondern auch eines dramatischen Wandels des menschlichen Selbstbildes, der zuallererst in der Medizin zu greifbaren Konsequenzen führt. Die Neuorganisation des Spitalwesens, die Entstehung der modernen Klinik und ihre Abkoppelung von den ärztlichen Praxen, die systematische Untersuchung von Leichnamen und die daraus resultierende pathologische Anatomie, die Entschleierung des Körperinnenraums und die neuen ärztlichen Fachsprachen - all dies entziffert Foucault als Anzeichen eines grundlegend neuen, rationalen Umgangs mit Krankheit und Tod. Die Krankheit ist nicht mehr das Unheil schlechthin, sondern ein endliches, körperliches Netz von Symptomen, das der ärztliche Blick leidenschaftslos freilegt. Der Tod ist nicht mehr metaphysischer Abgrund, sondern eine dem Körper inhärente Möglichkeit. Indem so die Medizin dem Menschen einen Spiegel radikaler Endlichkeit andauernd vorhält, rückt sie an einen zentralen Ort im System der Humanwissenschaften.",2990010,3.96,German,1499,Michel Foucault,224 pages,Naissance de la clinique,Paperback

Fourth Edition,"When The Universe Next Door was first introduced nearly thirty years ago, it set the standard for a clear, readable introduction to worldviews. In concise, easily understood prose, James W. Sire explained the basics of theism, deism, naturalism, nihilism, existentialism, Eastern monism and the new consciousness.The second edition was updated and expanded to include sections on Marxism and secular humanism, as well as a completely reworked chapter on what is now widely known as New Age philosophy rather than new consciousness. And the third edition offered further updating and revisions, including a thoroughly revised chapter on New Age philosophy and, perhaps most importantly, a new chapter on postmodernism.Now the fourth edition refines the definition of worldview itself, incorporating Sire's thinking and teaching during the past decade. (His recent work is showcased in a new book, Naming the Elephant, also published by IVP.) The Universe Next Door has been translated into several languages and has been used as a text at over one hundred colleges and universities in courses ranging from apologetics and world religions to history and English literature. With the publication of the fourth edition, this book will continue to aid students, teachers and anyone who wants to understand the variety of worldviews that compete with Christianity for the allegiance of our minds and hearts.",56647,3.9,English,3088,James W.
